# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

**RPIFrame** is a full-color digital photo frame application for Raspberry Pi 4 with Hosyond 7-inch DSI touchscreen. It was adapted from the InkFrame project (originally designed for e-ink displays) to work with modern DSI displays, providing full-color photo display with web-based management and touch navigation.

## Current Status - COMPLETED ✅

### What Was Accomplished
The complete RPIFrame DSI Photo Frame implementation has been finished and committed locally. All phases of the original development plan have been completed:

**✅ Phase 1: Analysis & Initial Setup**
- Analyzed InkFrame web server implementation and routes
- Understood photo uploading mechanism and storage  
- Identified image processing requirements (removed e-ink specific code)
- Copied and adapted core components to root directory

**✅ Phase 2: Core Functionality for DSI Display**
- Implemented Pygame-based fullscreen slideshow (`display_slideshow.py`)
- Configured for 800x480 Hosyond DSI display with FT5426 touch controller
- Added full-color image handling (no dithering/quantization needed)
- Integrated KMS/FKMS driver support for Pi OS Lite

**✅ Phase 3: Web Interface & Features**
- Adapted Flask web server (`app.py`) for DSI photo frame
- Implemented photo upload, management, and configuration
- Added image rotation controls and slideshow settings
- Created responsive web interface (`templates/index.html`)

**✅ Phase 4: Touchscreen Integration**
- Added Pygame touch event handling in slideshow
- Implemented swipe gesture navigation (left/right)
- Configured for FT5426 capacitive touch controller

**✅ Phase 5: Documentation & Deployment**
- Created comprehensive README.md
- Wrote detailed deployment guide for Pi OS Lite (64-bit)
- Built automated installation script (`install.sh`)
- Added validation checklist and deployment plan
- Included hardware manual for reference

## Architecture

The RPIFrame project follows a clean, modular architecture:

### Core Components
- **`main.py`**: Orchestrates both web server and display slideshow as separate processes
- **`app.py`**: Flask web application for photo management and settings
- **`display_slideshow.py`**: Pygame-based fullscreen photo display with touch controls
- **`install.sh`**: Automated installation script for Pi OS Lite

### Key Features Implemented
- 800×480 full-color photo display on DSI touchscreen
- Web interface accessible from any device on network
- Touch gesture navigation (swipe left/right for previous/next photo)
- Configurable slideshow intervals and image rotation
- Automatic thumbnail generation for web gallery
- Systemd service integration for auto-start on boot
- Optimized for headless Pi OS Lite (64-bit) operation

### Hardware Specifications (from manual)
- **Display**: Hosyond 7-inch DSI IPS touchscreen
- **Resolution**: 800×480 pixels  
- **Touch Controller**: FT5426 capacitive (2-point touch on Raspbian)
- **Interface**: MIPI DSI with RGB888
- **Power**: 3.3V, maximum 510mA
- **Included**: FPC cables, mounting hardware

## Key Commands

### Development/Testing
```bash
# Test display functionality
python test_display.py

# Run web interface only (for development)
python main.py --web-only --port 5000

# Run display only
python main.py --display-only

# Run full application
python main.py
```

### Deployment
```bash
# Automated installation on Pi OS Lite
./install.sh

# Manual service management
sudo systemctl start rpiframe.service
sudo systemctl stop rpiframe.service
sudo systemctl status rpiframe.service

# View logs
sudo journalctl -u rpiframe.service -f
tail -f logs/rpiframe.log
```

### Validation
```bash
# Quick validation check
./validate.sh

# Check service status
sudo systemctl status rpiframe.service

# Test web interface
curl http://localhost:5000/api/system/status
```

## Configuration

### Display Configuration (`config.json`)
```json
{
  "display": {
    "width": 800,
    "height": 480,
    "rotation": 0,
    "slideshow_interval": 60,
    "transition_effect": "fade"
  },
  "photos": {
    "directory": "photos",
    "allowed_extensions": ["png", "jpg", "jpeg", "gif", "bmp"],
    "max_upload_size_mb": 50
  },
  "system": {
    "web_port": 5000,
    "debug_mode": false,
    "enable_touch": true
  }
}
```

### Boot Configuration (Pi OS Lite)
For Hosyond 7-inch DSI display in `/boot/firmware/config.txt`:
```ini
# Enable FKMS (recommended for Pi 4)
dtoverlay=vc4-fkms-v3d
max_framebuffers=2
display_auto_detect=1
hdmi_force_hotplug=0
gpu_mem=128
```

## Current State & Next Steps

### Committed Locally ✅
- **Commit Hash**: `5638ea0`
- **Files**: 23 files committed
- **Status**: Complete implementation ready for deployment

### Still Needed ⏳
1. **Push to GitHub**: Need to configure git credentials and push
   ```bash
   git remote set-url origin https://github.com/USERNAME/RPIFrame.git
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Deploy on Raspberry Pi**: Once pushed, can deploy with:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/USERNAME/RPIFrame.git
   cd RPIFrame  
   ./install.sh
   ```

3. **Validation**: Use validation checklist to verify deployment

## Important Notes for Future Development

### Pi OS Lite Specific
- Uses direct framebuffer access via KMS driver (`SDL_VIDEODRIVER=kmsdrm`)
- No X11 dependencies - pure headless operation
- Optimized for limited resources (2GB Pi 4)
- Touch input via direct event handling

### Key Differences from InkFrame
- **Full-color display** instead of e-ink grayscale/dithering
- **Pygame instead of e-ink drivers** for display output
- **Touch navigation** instead of button controls
- **Faster refresh** (no e-ink refresh delays)
- **Simplified image processing** (no color quantization needed)

### Troubleshooting Resources
- `deployment.md`: Detailed Pi OS Lite setup instructions
- `VALIDATION_CHECKLIST.md`: Testing and validation procedures
- `DEPLOYMENT_PLAN.md`: Production deployment strategies
- `7inch-DSI-Display_User_Manual-V1.0.pdf`: Hardware reference

### Performance Considerations
- Optimized for Pi 4 with 2GB+ RAM
- Photos automatically resized to 800×480
- Thumbnails generated for web interface
- Service runs efficiently in background
- Memory usage ~200-300MB typical
